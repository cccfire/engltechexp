\subsection{Expert Study}

Below, we describe the procedure for our expert study of Odyssey.

\subsubsection{Introduction and Background (8 min)}
Our process began with an introduction and background session. 
This phase involved introductions 
  followed by a set of background questions 
  aimed at understanding the participant's experience 
  and usage habits around numerical analysis tools. 
We asked about the participant's years of experience, 
  when they last analysed 
  the error of a floating-point expression, 
  their typical workflow 
  for analysing high floating-point error expressions, 
  and their familiarity with the Herbie tool. 
If the participant was not a user of Herbie, 
  we sought to understand their reasons for not using it and 
  asked if there were ways they imagined Herbie
  fitting into their workflow.

\subsubsection{Tutorial (12 min)}
Following the introductory phase, 
  we gave the participant access to the Odyssey interface
  via Zoom and conducted a twelve-minute tutorial
  to familiarize them 
  with the Herbie interface. 
The tutorial demonstrated several features 
  using the expression $\sqrt{x + 1} - \sqrt{x}$ 
  for positive $x$. 
The features covered included 
  the specification of the expression being rewritten and ranges over which it must be accurate, 
  reading the error plots, local error identification, 
  selecting expressions from the rewriting table,
  expression editing, opening a new expression in a different tab, 
  and resampling on a different range. 
Throughout this tutorial, 
  we encouraged participants 
  to think out loud and provide feedback, 
  emphasizing our interest 
  in continuous interface improvement.

\subsubsection{Tasks (30-55 min)}
The next phase of our process was a task-oriented session 
  whose length depended on participant skill and availability. 
The tasks were designed to exercise different 
  parts of the interface and to reveal insights 
  about the participants' understanding 
  and ability to apply Odyssey for expression rewriting.
The tasks covered 
  identifying sources of error 
  in specific mathematical expressions, 
  using the Odyssey system 
  to find and recommend improvements, 
  evaluating the effectiveness of proposed solutions, 
  and identifying problems in automated solutions. 
For each task, 
  specific goals were set ahead of time in terms of interface usage 
  and problem-solving approach so we could decide 
  if Odyssey was able to meet the participant's need 
  and whether their usage represented a novel approach.
Here is the full list of tasks and usage goals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identify relevant sources of error in the Rust $asinh$ implementation.}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The participant should be able to determine the cause of the error by clicking on two different points to see at least two local error graphs.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Use Odyssey to find and recommend $hypot$.}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The participant should submit $sqrt(x * x + 1)$ in a new tab, ask Herbie for rewritings, and obtain $hypot(1, x)$ or another solution.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Determine whether the solution to task 2 is good enough.}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The participant should be able to integrate the result from task 2 into the original expression and refer to the error plot to justify their answer.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Identify problems with branches (regimes) in automated solutions.}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The participant should be able to highlight areas of concern by clicking on points around 1, where higher error is shown.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Use Odyssey to find and recommend a way of solving small $x$ with $log1p$.}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The participant should be able to find a good solution for the entire range of positive $x$ values that doesn’t include branches using Herbie's suggestions.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Determine trust in the expression.}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The participant should be able to verify the expression's equivalence to the original by checking the expression derivation.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Use Odyssey to create a branched solution.}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The participant should be able to create a branched expression that outperforms Herbie’s solution.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Survey and discussion (10-15 min)}
In the final phase, 
  we conducted a Google Forms survey that lasted between 10 to 15 minutes.
  The survey questions and results can be found in Table \ref{fig:survey-results}.
