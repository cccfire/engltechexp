A real number is represented as a sequence of finite B-adic numbers and for each classical function (rational, algebraic or transcendental), we describe how to produce a sequence representing the result of the application of this function to its arguments, according to the sequences representing these arguments. For each algorithm we prove that the resulting sequence is a valid representation of the exact real result. This arithmetic is the first real arithmetic with mathematically proved algorithms."
